## 🔧 Customization Options

### Increase Data Volume
Edit the seeders to create more records:

```php
// In UserSeeder.php
User::factory(50)->create(); // More users

// In AdditionalEventSeeder.php  
Event::factory(20)->published()->create(); // More events

// In RegistrationSeeder.php
Registration::factory(100)->create(); // More registrations
```

### Modify Event Types
Add new event categories in `EventFactory.php`:

```php
$eventTypes = [
    'workshop' => [...],
    'conference' => [...], 
    'networking' => [...],
    'webinar' => [...], // New type
    'certification' => [...], // New type
];
```
